                            <h2>Meet William Ndut</h2> 
                            <P>I’m a communication professional with 13+ years of experience, hopping across industries from fintech and wealth management to education, nonprofits, and yes—even plantations. Over the years, I’ve worn more hats than a Broadway costume department: Communication Director, Author, Coach, Crisis Firefighter, Storyteller, Consultant, Partnership Builder, and of course, Public Speaker!</P>

                            <P>Indonesia’s #1 digital investment app, consulting for the Singapore FinTech Festival, mentoring startups with Austrade’s Landing Pads Program, and teaching at both The University of Western Australia and Universitas Indonesia. Oh, and I also led communications for the Indonesia Fintech Summit 2020 (opened by the President of Indonesia, no less) and the International Services Summit 2016 with some of Asia-Pacific’s finest.</P>
                            
                            <P>Somehow, between all that, I also found time to author seven books (plus co-author two more), including a trilogy on Public Speaking, Strategic Networking, and Professional Branding. My words and works have popped up in 20+ media outlets, from Financial Times and Nikkei Asia to CNBC and The Jakarta Post. Along the way, I’ve also picked up a few awards for business pitching and corporate communication.</P>
                            
                            <P>On stage, I’ve delivered 200+ talks across Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, and the UK. My proudest moment? My plenary at the Australian International Education Conference (2019), sharing the stage with Australia’s Foreign Minister, the Premier and Governor of Western Australia, and a TIME 100 List honoree.</P>

                            <p>And because good stories deserve a happy ending: I graduated magna cum laude (twice!)—first with a Bachelor of Communication Science degree from Universitas Pelita Harapan (full scholarship), then with a Master of Strategic Communication degree from The University of Western Australia (thanks to a scholarship from the Government of Indonesia).</p>

                            <P>In short: I connect, coach, and inspire people with ideas and opportunities—and I make sure they stick, one step at a time.</P>

                <h2>Anak Jakarta Barat di Australia Barat: Tidak Ada yang Namanya Kebetulan</h2>
                <P>This reflective memoir captures the heartfelt journey of a man (yeah, that man is me!) from Jakarta Barat (West Jakarta) finding my way in Western Australia. Blending humor, struggle, and reflection, I share the bittersweet moments of leaving home, adapting to a foreign land, and redefining myself along the way. What might look like coincidence—meeting the right people, facing unexpected hurdles, stumbling into new opportunities—reveals itself as a tapestry of meaning. This book ultimately reminds the readers that life’s detours and delays are never random. Each twist carries purpose, shaping not just where we arrive, but who we become.</P>

                <h2>Gagal, Kebal, Fenomenal: Seni Cari Nama untuk Profesional</h2>
                <P>Gagal, Kebal, Fenomenal: Seni Cari Nama untuk Profesional begins with William’s assertion that 99% of people experience more failures than successes, reframing professional branding as the art of transforming setbacks into credibility. Through the three-phase model of coping with failures—Experiment, Experienced, Empowered—this book argues that professional branding is not only about digital presence, LinkedIn optimization, or aggressive self-marketing, but also authenticity, perseverance, and consistent value delivery. By blending cultural nuance, reflective exercises, and practical guidance, the book invites the readers to recognize the role of failure in growth, strengthen their mental toughness, and translate lessons into visible impact and long-term reputation. This approach offers an alternative model of branding rooted in substance rather than visibility alone.</P>

                <h2>Networking: Seni Nyetor (dan Cari) Muka untuk Profesional</h2>
                <P>Networking: Seni Nyetor (dan Cari) Muka untuk Profesional positions networking as a strategic yet culturally grounded practice. Unlike mainstream texts, which emphasize charisma, persuasion, and opportunity maximization, this book situates networking within Indonesian professional and social contexts, where cultural nuance, humility, and reciprocity play pivotal roles. Through the “Three Phases of Networking”—Structural, Strategic, Symbolic—as well as the concept of “Balance Sheet” and “Enabler”, this book argues that effective networking is not transactional, but relational, anchored in trust, presence, and sustained engagement. This perspective distinguishes the book as both locally relevant and globally resonant</P>

                <h2>Pesan dari Murid untuk Guru: Siapapun Bisa Melakukan Kesalahan</h2>
                <P>Pesan dari Murid untuk Guru: Siapapun Bisa Melakukan Kesalahan challenges the conventional view of school as a rigid environment where teachers are infallible and students bear sole responsibility for mistakes. It advocates for a more compassionate and democratic perspective, encouraging students to be attentive, adaptable, and proactive in navigating their academic life. This book urges stakeholders in Indonesia’s education sector to transform classrooms into inspiring spaces, as enchanting as Disneyland, spaces that spark curiosity and allow students to shine. Through practical and innovative ideas, this book empowers students to embrace change, find joy in the learning process, and recognize mistakes not as failures, but as valuable stepping stones toward growth and excellence</P>

                <P>Public Speaking: Seni Menguasai (dan Cari Panggung) untuk Profesional frames public speaking not only as a communicative skill but as a strategic career lever. While conventional handbooks often focus narrowly on delivery techniques—voice, posture, or stage presence—this book expands the scope by linking speaking to professional visibility, leadership identity, and personal branding. Through the “Three Phases of Public Speaking”—Insecure, Intermediate, Impact—this book integrates theoretical frameworks with actionable exercises, guiding readers through managing anxiety, crafting messages, and cultivating audience connection. The emphasis on the three phases distinguishes the book, positioning public speaking as both a performance and a deliberate act of influence, central to professional growth.</P>

                <h2>Tiga Tahun dari Sekarang</h2>
                <P>Tiga Tahun dari Sekarang frames the three-year horizon (senior highschool period in Indonesia) as an effective planning window—long enough for meaningful change, yet near enough to remain practical. It blends self-reflection with structured exercises, guiding readers to articulate goals, design habits, and cultivate networks aligned with their aspirations. William’s approach is pragmatic: transformation comes not from drastic leaps but from consistent, incremental steps. Ultimately, this book positions long-term intentionality as a discipline that empowers individuals to balance ambition with adaptability in navigating personal and professional growth. William also offers the concept of three pillars to strengthen Indonesia’s education sector: Critical Thinking, Dialogue, and Culture of Life-time Learning.</P>

William presents Tjipta not only as a witness to Indonesia’s turbulent political transitions but also as an active voice shaping public discourse through the media. The narrative traces Tjipta’s career in journalism, his fearless critiques of power, and commitment to nurturing future generations as an educator. Blending biography with analysis, the book highlights Tjipta’s intellectual integrity, independence, and enduring influence, offering readers both inspiration and insight into the role of public intellectuals in Indonesia’s democratic journey.</P>

His development of the ‘Australia My Second Home: Voices of Hope and Optimism from the Down Under’ Zoom workshop was innovative - one of the first of its kind - and opened so many doors for us as panellists, and for our audience alike, to start building lasting connections during a difficult and isolating time.”</p>
